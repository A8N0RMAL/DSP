# DSP
Taking input that is a formula and give me the shape of the signal as output
Here's a detailed explanation of the code:

1. The code imports the `numpy` and `matplotlib.pyplot` libraries, which are used to generate the signal and plot it.

2. The code defines a function called `plot_signal`, which takes in four arguments: `formula`, `start`, `end`, and `num_points`. This function generates a plot of the signal based on the input formula.

3. The `np.linspace` function is used to generate an array of `x` values that are evenly spaced between the `start` and `end` times. The `num_points` variable is used to specify the number of points to generate.

4. The `eval` function is used to evaluate the input formula using the generated `x` values to generate the corresponding `y` values.

5. The `matplotlib.pyplot` library is used to plot the signal using the `plt.plot` function. The `x` and `y` arrays are passed as arguments to this function. The `xlabel`, `ylabel`, and `title` functions are used to label the x-axis, y-axis, and plot respectively. The `grid(True)` command adds a grid to the plot.

6. The code prompts the user to input a formula for the signal using the `input` function. The formula should use the variable `x` to represent the time axis.

7. The `start`, `end`, and `num_points` variables are defined beforehand to specify the range of `x` values and the number of points to generate for the plot.

8. The `plot_signal` function is called with the input formula and the specified `start`, `end`, and `num_points` values to generate the plot.

Overall, this code is a simple and easy-to-use tool for visualizing signals based on user-defined formulas. It uses the `numpy` and `matplotlib.pyplot` libraries to generate the signal and plot it, and allows the user to input any formula that uses `x` as the variable to represent the time axis.
